# SCI-Overlay-Public
https://sc-intelligence.net/ 

The Public Repository of the SC Intelligence Overlay where you can find the latest installer and patch notes.

SCI is the tool to quickly look up Star Citizen Players and Organisations for intel, create notes for these and to share your searches and notes within your Group or Organisation.
Star Citizen Intelligence is currently available as an App (Overlay) or a Bot for your Discord Server.

[Download](https://github.com/Lauze1/SCI-Overlay-Public/releases/latest/download/SCIOverlayInstaller.exe)

The tool is **free to use for everyone**, but as a student i'd be very happy about a [donation](https://ko-fi.com/lauze) if you like it 🙂

If you found a bug, have a feature request or any other question, please open a new thread in the ⁠**sci-forum** on [the MPeX Discord Server](https://discord.gg/yKVuXTegYn) or **send me a DM** (Discord-Name: **lauze.py**). 

## Features

* Search Players and Organisations in a fast and compact way, which includes following:
  * Basic Information from the RSI website
  * Notes you or someone in one of your groups created
* join and create groups, which allows you to
  * create notes (write whatever you want, only group-members can see it)
  * get notifications (within the overlay) when someone writes a note, joins the group, or decides to share a name (via a button in the search results)
  * -> Group Management can be done directly in the settings of the overlay (includes Create, Join, Invite, changing Roles, Leave, Kick, and more)

-> Most features work in the Overlay and the Bot, while some may currently be missing for the Bot.
